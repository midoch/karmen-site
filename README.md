# Karmen site project

## Task

Recreate a figma layout, of a webshop site. Get it as close as possible.

## Thoughts

This was an assignment within a school project. I learned more about html, css and more JS.
i havent done any responsive layout for the mobile devices and ipad devices.
also learned about validation within forms. which i found to be pretty nice.
